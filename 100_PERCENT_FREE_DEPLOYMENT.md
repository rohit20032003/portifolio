## For Your React Portfolio

Since your portfolio uses React + Express, you'll need to:

**Option A: Static Build**
```bash
npm run build
```
Then upload the `dist` folder contents to GitHub Pages

**Option B: Client-Only Version**
I can create a simplified version that works on GitHub Pages without the backend server.

- Fast loading worldwide
- Mobile responsive design
