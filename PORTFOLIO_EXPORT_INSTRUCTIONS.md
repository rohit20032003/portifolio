# How to Get Your Portfolio Files from Replit

Since direct download isn't working, here are alternative methods:

## Method 1: Use Replit's Export Feature
1. Go to the three dots menu (⋯) in the top right of Replit
2. Click "Download as ZIP"
3. This will download your entire Replit project
4. Extract the ZIP file on your computer
5. You'll have all your portfolio files

## Method 2: Copy Files Manually
I'll show you exactly what files you need and their content below.

## Method 3: Create GitHub Repository
1. In Replit, click the version control icon (looks like a branch)
2. Click "Create a Git repo"
3. Commit your files
4. Push to GitHub
5. You can then clone or download from GitHub

## Method 4: Use Replit's Shell
1. Open the Shell tab in Replit
2. Run: `zip -r portfolio.zip client server shared public *.json *.ts *.js *.md`
3. This creates a portfolio.zip file you can download

## Your Portfolio Files Structure

Here's exactly what you need for your portfolio:

```
portfolio/
├── package.json
├── vite.config.ts  
├── tsconfig.json
├── tailwind.config.ts
├── postcss.config.js
├── components.json
├── index.html (from client folder)
├── src/ (copy from client/src/)
├── server/
├── shared/
└── public/
```
